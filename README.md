# Saathi-Carpooling-Report

I was part of the development of Saathi, a mobile application designed to offer efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly carpooling solutions. Using the MERN stack and microservices architecture, I built a scalable backend, which was deployed with Docker for continuous deployment to ensure a seamless user experience. The application featured an integrated A* route-matching system linked with Google Maps APIs that optimised travel routes. Additionally, we designed wireframes on Figma and conducted user experience testing and user testing to refine the appâ€™s interface and usability. Saathi was awarded Best Final Year Project for its innovative approach to sustainable transportation.
